# MicroGears
MicroGears a super lightweight micro framework for reactive services

MicroGears was build with 3 main objectives in mind.

* enforce immutability of function parameters
* enable your service to be filtered in a transparent way (with more then one filter simultaneously)
* help to administer service dependency in favor of a better and more controlled test environment
